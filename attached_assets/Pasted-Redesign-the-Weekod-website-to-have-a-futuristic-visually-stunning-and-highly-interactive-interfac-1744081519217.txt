Redesign the Weekod website to have a futuristic, visually stunning, and highly interactive interface while maintaining clarity and performance.

🧠 Design Style:
Futuristic, sleek, and minimal

Glassmorphism and Neumorphism elements

Smooth, immersive transitions (use Framer Motion or GSAP)

Layered effects, shadows, and gradients with subtle 3D depth

High-tech typefaces (e.g., Orbitron, Exo, Eurostile, or modern sans-serif like Inter)

💻 Homepage Design Breakdown:
1. Hero Section
Dark or gradient background with particles or dynamic shapes (Three.js or Lottie animation)

Large bold headline with a neon or soft-glow effect

Animated “Start Your Project” + “Schedule a Call” buttons with hover glow

Floating or 3D logo animation (subtle pulsing/glow)

Add relevant background motion: like Zoma

2. Services/Features Section
Use futuristic icons (animated SVGs)

Split-card layout with hover flips or subtle zoom effects

Use glass-like translucent card design with a neon glow border

Animate each card on scroll with fade-slide effect

3. “Start Your Project” CTA
Place inside a dynamic curved section

Add a glowing arrow or chevron animating toward the button

On hover: button should “charge up” (animated borders or particle effect)

4. Budget Section
Create an interactive budget slider (custom-styled, not default)

Budget ranges should show immediate change with preview animation or UI hints

Use futuristic toggles and tier cards (Starter, Growth, Enterprise)

5. Get in Touch Section
Fix responsiveness issues — space the form correctly on mobile

Add floating labels inside inputs

Background: low-opacity tech patterns, lines, or holographic textures

6. Footer
Use a dark transparent background with neon-lit section dividers

Animated social icons with glowing border pulses

Include a back-to-top button with scroll animation

📱 Mobile-First Enhancements:
Stack buttons & forms with gap spacing and padding

Add collapsible navbar with hamburger menu (slide-in)

Mobile version must maintain futuristic feel with large tap targets and smooth transitions

🖼️ Assets & Visuals Suggestions:
Use futuristic illustrations from Storyset, LottieFiles, or 3D assets from Spline

Compress all images for web performance

💡 Bonus Enhancements:
Add a “Live Chat” floating icon with typing animation

Use scroll-triggered animations for content load

Include subtle background audio (muted by default) or ambient hum
